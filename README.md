# Data Alchemist  
**AI-Powered Data Validation & Correction System**

---

## üìÑ Abstract

**Data Alchemist** is an intelligent system designed to validate, correct, and enhance large datasets in real-time. It combines manual rule-based validation with AI-powered reasoning (via Hugging Face models) to not only detect errors but also provide auto-suggestions, bulk corrections, and detailed reasoning for each correction.

### Core Capabilities:
- **Real-Time Validation:** Live validation of fields, cross-references, priority levels, and more.
- **AI-Powered Corrections:** Utilizes large language models to automatically suggest and apply corrections.
- **Bulk Operations:** Smart bulk fixes like tag normalization, priority adjustments, and attribute standardization.
- **Natural Language Data Editing:** Conversational, plain-English data manipulation.
- **Interactive UI:** Real-time error tracking, correction application, and AI feedback visualization.

By combining deterministic validation, AI-enhanced reasoning, and an intuitive interface, **Data Alchemist** accelerates data cleaning, improves data quality, and empowers confident interaction with large datasets.

## Precautions

*   The Hugging Face API is currently being accessed via the **free tier**, which may lead to:
*     
*   Occasional rate-limiting issues.
*         
*   Potential slow API responses.
*         
*   Temporary API unavailability
