# Data Alchemist
**AI-Powered Data Validation & Correction System**

## Abstract

Data Alchemist is an intelligent system designed to validate, correct, and enhance large datasets in real-time. It combines manual rule-based validation with AI-powered reasoning (via Hugging Face models) to not only detect errors but also provide auto-suggestions, bulk corrections, and detailed reasoning for each correction.

At its core, Data Alchemist provides:

- **Real-Time Validation:** Validate fields, cross-references, priority levels, and more with live feedback.
- **AI-Powered Corrections:** Leverage large language models to automatically suggest and optionally apply corrections.
- **Bulk Operations:** Suggest smart bulk fixes such as tag normalization, priority adjustments, and attribute standardization.
- **Natural Language Data Editing:** Enable conversational data modifications using plain English.
- **Interactive UI:** Real-time error tracking, correction application, and AI feedback visualization.

By combining deterministic validation, AI-enhanced reasoning, and intuitive interfaces, Data Alchemist accelerates data cleaning, improves data quality, and enables users to interact with datasets at scale confidently.
